## 📝 Problem Statements and Objectives

This project addresses the detection and classification of vehicles and human actions using the YOLOv8 object detection framework. All three tasks leverage **YOLOv8**, fine-tuned on specific datasets relevant to each objective.

---

### ✅ Task 1: Vehicle Detection in Parking Spaces 

**Objective**: Train a robust YOLOv8 model to identify occupied and empty parking slots in images and videos of parking lots.

**Dataset Used**: **PKLot dataset (PUCPR subset)**, containing annotated images of parking slots.

**Goals**:
- Detect both occupied and empty slots accurately using bounding boxes.
- Fine-tune YOLOv8 on the PKLot dataset for high-precision slot detection.

- Deliverables include training code, model weights, evaluation results, and a demonstration video.

---

### ✅ Task 2: Deployment Demonstration on Edge Devices 

**Objective**: Deploy the Task 1 YOLOv8 model on an edge device (or simulate it) and demonstrate its real-time inference capabilities.

**Tools & Techniques**: 
- **ONNX export**, **Dynamic Quantization**, and **ONNX Runtime** for inference.
- Simulated edge deployment setup measuring **FPS**, **CPU**, and **GPU utilization**.

**Goals**:
- Convert and optimize the YOLOv8 model for lightweight edge inference.
- Evaluate performance under realistic constraints.
- Provide scripts, performance logs, annotated output, and a deployment demo video.

---

### ✅ Task 3 (Bonus): YOLO Extension for Human Action Detection 

**Objective**: Modify the YOLOv8 pipeline to detect human actions like **falling** and **dribbling**.

**Dataset Used**: **HMDB51 dataset**, using extracted frames from classes: `fall_floor` and `dribble`.

**Goals**:

## 🧾 Dataset Preparation and Preprocessing

To ensure high model accuracy and generalization, careful dataset preparation and preprocessing were performed for each task. This involved selecting suitable public datasets, organizing data into YOLOv8-compatible formats, and applying augmentation techniques where necessary.

Below, we describe the data pipeline used for each task separately.



### 📁 Task 1: Vehicle Detection using PKLot Dataset

For Task 1, we used the **PKLot dataset**, downloaded via **Roboflow** in **Pascal VOC XML format**. The dataset was then converted to YOLOv8 format and augmented to improve generalization and robustness.

#### 🔗 Dataset Source
We downloaded the raw PKLot dataset from Roboflow:
**[PKLot on Roboflow (VOC XML)](https://universe.roboflow.com/sovan-dev/pklot-raw)**

---

## 🛠️ YOLOv8 Dataset Preparation & Augmentation

### 📁 1. Directory Setup
- Defined input and output paths.
- Created subdirectories:
  - `images/` for image files.
  - `labels/` for YOLO-format annotation files.
- Split data into `train`, `valid`, and `test`.

### 🔁 2. Data Augmentation using Albumentations
- Applied augmentations:
  - `HorizontalFlip(p=0.5)`
  - `RandomBrightnessContrast(p=0.3)`
  - `Rotate(limit=15, p=0.2)`
  - `MotionBlur(p=0.1)`
- Bounding boxes were preserved using `bbox_params`.

### 📦 3. VOC to YOLO Format Conversion
- Converted each Pascal VOC bounding box to YOLO format:
  - `x_center = (xmin + xmax)/2`
  - `y_center = (ymin + ymax)/2`
  - `width = xmax - xmin`
  - `height = ymax - ymin`
- Normalized by image width and height.

### 📄 4. XML Annotation Parsing
- Parsed `.xml` annotation files.
- Filtered to include only:
  - `space-empty` → class `0`
  - `space-occupied` → class `1`

### ✍️ 5. Save YOLO Labels
- Saved a `.txt` YOLO-format label file for each image.

### 🔁 6. Process Images
For each image in `train`, `valid`, and `test`:
1. Parsed and converted the annotation.
2. Saved the original image and label.
3. Generated **2 augmented versions** using the defined pipeline.
4. Saved augmented images and labels.
